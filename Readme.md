# Temperature

Game created for Godot's game jam. https://itch.io/jam/godotjam062018

If you want to generate the weather temperatures you should get an API key from https://openweathermap.org and store it inside a file named `settings` in the root of the dir. After getting a valid API key, you can run `python weather.py` and it will generate a `data.json` file that you can use for the game. Right now the default url for that data is set to this repo `data.json` file hosted using Github Pages.
