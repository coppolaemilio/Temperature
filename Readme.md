# The Weather Guy

Dear Weather Guy:
The screen that displays the real temperatures is not working. But since you are an expert you don't really need it. Right?
You will see the name of a city and you wil have to say the **REAL** temperature for that city **IN REAL LIFE RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT**.

By the way, we are live in 10 seconds.

## About the game:

Game created for [Godot Community Game Jam - June 2018](https://itch.io/jam/godotjam062018). 

If you want to generate the weather temperatures you should get an API key from https://openweathermap.org and store it inside a file named `settings` in the root of the dir. After getting a valid API key, you can run `python weather.py` and it will generate a `data.json` file that you can use for the game. Right now the default url for that data is set to this repo `data.json` file hosted using Github Pages.
